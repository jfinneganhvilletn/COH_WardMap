# COH_WardMap
Ward Map for City of Hendersonville, TN

## this is an attempt to make a psuedo interactive ward map reflecting the changes made after the 2021 redistricting fro the city of Hendersonville, TN. Goal is to use ArcGIS API for Javascript functionality to allow more customizable content to have hover highlighting, as well as downloadeable maps for each ward and hyperlinks to the city alderman and mayor webpages. May add outlines of outdated boundars to show how boundaries have changed
